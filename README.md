Project I made for application for the Java traineeship of Young Capital. 

Home Automation simulation:
Create automations by linking devices, for example: 
- If table light goes on, also turn on the kitchen light.
Make chains, continuing example: 
- If Kitchen Light turns on, also turn on wifi. 
Now if the table light turns on, it triggers the automation that turns on the kitchen light, which in its turn triggers the next automation which turns on wifi. 
One button now controls three devices :)
